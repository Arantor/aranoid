# Aranoid

Aranoid is a loose Arkanoid clone, written in Godot as a sort of learning exercise.

Why the name? Well, I'm Arantor, it's my project, it's an Arkanoid clone, so... Ara-noid. I am mindful it's a _bit_ close to the original but I'm pretty certain no-one is going to be able to confuse them...

## Art

The art is “[Iron Plague / Sinistar](https://lostgarden.home.blog/2005/03/30/download-a-complete-set-of-sweet-8-bit-sinistar-clone-graphics/)” art by Daniel Cook (https://lostgarden.home.blog/) 

Admittedly, this isn't really an Arkanoid style set of tiles, but it's an interesting journey in making do and treating it as a fun exercise, where I have a limitation that isn't really a limitation.

More might come along, we'll see.

## Code

The code is mine. It's not good code, it's really not, it does all the things it's not supposed to do, massively tight and explicit coupling between things, minimal use of signals etc. but I'm more interested in the ways I can put the puzzle pieces together and wire them up more than I am about best practice. Especially because in my experience best practice usually lands you in a whole that you have to play dirty to get out of and knowing what my options are is usually a good place to be.

But if it matters, the code is MIT (2 clause) licensed, the other assets are under their own licences.
